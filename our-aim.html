      <hr class="many-line">
      ​<li>Year 2020: emergence of sars-cov-2 leading to covid-19 pandemic thereby raising awarness among people about the importance of sanitization and cleaniness and senitizing population at large about disinfecting cleaning and sanitizing
        everything around them and to reach the whole of india through online sales via our own website,flipkart,amazon etc.</li>
      <hr class="many-line">
      <li>Sanitization / fogging / fumigation is a costly affair, moreover they contain alcohol and harmful chemicals which in itself are health hazards. Along with it Mosquitoes are a huge problem in a densely populated country like India. Aarogya
        Shield would help in Combating the Mosquito Problem Naturally.</li>
      <hr class="many-line">
      <li>This makes it out of reach for millions of common household who rather than deploying costly sanitization technique chose to leave their fate in the hands of almighty.</li>
      <hr class="many-line">
      <li>This leaves the houses, offices, shops of millions of indians ‘ at risk’ making the dwellers in the same more prone to viral infection thereby exposing their immunity level and making them more susceptible to the wrath of covid-19.</li>
      <hr class="many-line">
      <li>As Aarogya Shield is a brand new product and directly relates with the current pandemic due to its unique USP i.e its sanitization properties, therefore to start with the entire domestic market falls under the purview of the product via the
        online medium and locally (offline medium) the eastern region would be the starting point.</li>
